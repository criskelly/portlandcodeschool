    %h2 About Us
    %p Portland Code School students learn from experienced programmers, develop the skills needed to join a leading tech company, and have direct access to local sponsoring companies interested in hiring new developers.
    %p There is a huge and rapidly growing demand for able-minded programmers who are not only capable of skillful programming, but also skillful at communicating with clients and peers. Tech shops cannot exist with single-faceted programmers alone; the most valuable programmers are those that easily interact with clients and produce outstanding quality code.

      %h2 Our History
      %p The Portland Code School was founded in September of 2012 as a program within Burnside Digital. The code school began as an apprentice-type internship program and evolved into a full-fledged code school.
      %p The Portland Code School began as an idea when founder Chuck Lauer Vose realized how huge the demand was for competent programmers in Portland and how few new programmers there were coming from Portland. After teaching a “Rapid Web Development” course at the Portland Art Institute, Chuck realized there is an abyss of misunderstandings, gaps in information, and false starts between beginner tutorials and full-time software development. Too many programmers were getting lost in this abyss. Since Portland is already a top-notch city for developers; Chuck wanted to make it an oasis for newcomers also.
      %p Through collaboration with and help from programmer communities across Portland and beyond, the Portland Code School was born.

      Bill has been a constant source of inspiration and sound judgement for us in the formation of the program. His experience in tech education and his drive to see the program succeed has been unendingly inspiring and helpful. He was the initial sounding board, and the voice of reason, when there were so many voices to listen to.

      Hal has been a godsend at the late stages of the first session by helping us coordinate and understand how to talk to CTOs and VPs at organizations that need to find great people. His words of wisdom, his network of peers, and his gentle guidance were brought to bare at exactly the right time.

      Everyone at Burnside Digital was amazing, but these four stepped forward frequently and helped me through jams with either sweat or brainpower. One man can only do so much.

      The first group of students, the guinnea pigs. I have no words for the depth of gratitude I have towards this trio and I can't wait to see them flourish in their new careers!
