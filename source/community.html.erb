<div class="readable-width">
  <h2>Community Engagement</h2>
  <p>Because learning happens inside and outside the classroom and because we love the vibrant, energetic, exciting community life that makes Portland such a special place, the Portland Code School supports and participates in community groups, meet-ups, and hacker groups all over Portland. </p>
  <p>You will find our students out and about in the community attending, organizing, and volunteering for meet-ups, networking events, workshops, talks, and socials.</p>

  <h3>Growing the learner community in Portland</h3>
  <p>The Portland Code School is also involved in organizing <strong>Hack+Help</strong>, a meet-up for newcomers to Ruby and/or web development as well as experienced programmers. Participants can find their peer learning groups to hack on projects together and help each other out if anyone gets stuck. New aspiring programmers are encouraged to come and find a Portland Code School student to talk with and get excellent beginner help.</p>
  <p>Find out when the next <strong>Hack+Help</strong> session is  <a href="http://calagator.org/events/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=hack+%2B+help">Here</a>.</p>
