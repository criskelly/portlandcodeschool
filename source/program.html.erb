  <h2>Program Overview</h2>
  <p>The Portland Code School runs three 12-week sessions each year. The application process is competitive and students are selected based on their passion for programming, their strong communication skills, and their ability to work as part of a team.</p>

  <h3>Class Structure</h3>
  <p>Class structure and lessons follow agile methodologies; we hold a standup meeting each day to recognize what everyone is doing, we demo weekly, and we hold a planning and a retrospective meeting each week.</p>
  <p>The program is organized around four key concepts essential to being a successful web developer:
    <ul>
      <li>Web skills</li>
      <li>Programming skills</li>
      <li>Hands-on Experience</li>
      <li>Networking and Community Engagement</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>After Graduation</h3>
  <p>We strongly believe that education doesn't end when the program does. We maintain a post-graduation mailing-list and chatroom as well as opportunities to connect with programmer networks, workshops, and professional development opportunities.</p>
